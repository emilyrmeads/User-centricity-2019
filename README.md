# Agile as an approach to digitial transformation
## What is digital transformation? 
Digital transformation has many definitions, because each company or business will go through digital transformation in a different way. Some of the core ideas that a digital transformation incorportates are the ability to change and adapt to the rapidly evolving digital world. It involves a shift in leadership, thinking, and encourages innovation and new business models. Often, companies undergo digital transformation not because they want to, but because they *need* to. We are in an age where companies that are unable to undertake appropriate digital transformations *will* fall behind, and fail. 
## The role of a manager is to deliver business value. / What is the role of a manager?
The core role of a manager is to deliver business value, and business value stands on a few important pillars. Traditionally the pillars of delivering business value are:

  - Reducing costs
  - Reducing risks 
  - Increasing revenue
  
The manager therefore looks to oversee and maintain these pillars in a sustainable way, in order to continue to guarantee the delivery of business value. But today business value is something that is constantly changing, and changing fast. Users have access to nicer, cheaper and higher quality products and services all the time! And because these other products/services are so easily accessible, the user rapidly knows exactly what it wants and needs. This brings us to the importance of user centred development. User centricity is so important that it has become a new pillar of business value. You could therefore say that the driving pillars of business value all revolve around user centricity today.

Without user centricity, companies can not go through a digital transformation.

It is only by focusing on the specific needs of the user that a business can hope to keep up with the evolving scope of their product/service. By keeping an end-user at the heart of what drives the product development, the end result is a lot more likely to be useful, meaningful, and usable.

## Project vs Product 

To take a look at what kind of philosophies/practices/mindsets are needed to adopt this user-centricity let's take a look at the differences between a project mindset and a product mindset. 
### Project mindset 

In the 50's projects became much more common. Introduced the role of project manager. The role of the project manager is to come up with a plan for a project, figure out how to carry out this plan and determine a schedule for everything, as well as come up with a budget to complete the project. This forms a project management triangle.

As a good project manager, you delivery your project on time, on budget, and on scope. A project is nothing else than a container for all the activities that we lay out in sequence. This works very well if you are sure of what you are doing, and that the market around you does not evolve. 
Quote of former Nokia CEO "WE didn't do anything wrong, but somehow we lost." The market changed and people were no longer buying Nokias! By ignoring the change in the market and not adjusting the scope, Nokia lost. 

### Product mindset 

A  product mindset goes out into the market and tries to find out what the custommer really needs NOW. A product mindset wants to find out what challenges the end-user is having, what are the end-user's requirements, and how they can be helped in the most efficient way possible. By having a closer look at the end user's needs, you can have a more accurate scope for what you want to do, and from this figure out how to validate this scope. But the scope must be evaluated to extract what the highest possible value, and minimum viable product that can be produced in order to validate the assumption regarding the market. This can then be executed quickly and a working product can be pushed into the market to collect feedback
